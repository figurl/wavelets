# Signal Compression

The plots below demonstrate signal compression at different NRMSE targets. You can adjust the wavelet type, number of samples to display, and optional frequency filtering.

- **NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error)**: Measures the difference between original and compressed signals
- **Compression Ratio**: The ratio of original to compressed data size
