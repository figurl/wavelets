# Lossy Time Series Compression for Electrophysiology

This platform provides an interactive environment to explore lossy compression techniques for electrophysiology data, including Quantized Wavelet Transform (QWT) and Quantized Fourier Compression (QFC). As electrophysiology datasets grow larger, traditional lossless methods achieve only limited compression ratios (2-4x). QWT and QFC offer significantly higher ratios (10-30x) by strategically reducing data entropy while preserving essential signal characteristics.

Select one of the following topics to begin exploring:

- **[Wavelets](./wavelets.md)**: Understand the building blocks of wavelet analysis
- **[Compression](./compression.md)**: Learn how wavelets can be used for signal compression
- **[Compute Time](./compute_time.md)**: Explore the computational performance of different wavelet transforms
