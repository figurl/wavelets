# Wavelet Explorer

This interactive tool helps you understand and experiment with discrete wavelets, especially in the context of compressing time series data, e.g., electrophysiology signals.

It uses [PyWavelets](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/) running in your browser through [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), a Python runtime for the web.
