# Wavelet Explorer

This interactive tool helps you understand and experiment with discrete wavelets, especially in the context of compressing time series data, e.g., electrophysiology signals.

It uses [PyWavelets](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/) running in your browser through [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), a Python runtime for the web.

Select one of the topics above to begin exploring:

- **Wavelets**: Understand the building blocks of wavelet analysis
- **Compression**: Learn how wavelets can be used for signal compression
- **Compute Time**: Explore the computational performance of different wavelet transforms
